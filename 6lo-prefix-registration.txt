              IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Registration
                 draft-ietf-6lo-prefix-registration-05

Abstract

   This document updates IPv6 Neighbor Discovery RFC4861 and the 6LoWPAN
   extensions (RFC8505, RFC8928, RFC7400) to enable a node that owns or
   is directly connected to a prefix to register that prefix to neighbor
   routers.  The registration indicates that the registered prefix can
   be reached via the advertising node without a loop.  The unicast
   prefix registration also provides a protocol-independent interface
   for the node to request neighbor router(s) to redistribute the prefix
   to the larger routing domain using their specific routing protocols.
   This document extends RPL (RFC6550, RFC6553, RFC9010) to enable the
   6LR to inject the registered prefix in RPL.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


1.  Introduction

   The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally
   focused on saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of
   all.  Other design constraints, such as a limited memory capacity,
   duty cycling of the LLN devices and low-power lossy transmissions,
   derive from that primary concern.  The radio (both transmitting or
   simply listening) is a major energy drain and the LLN protocols must
   be adapted to allow the nodes to remain sleeping with the radio
   turned off at most times.

   The "Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks" [RFC6550]
   (RPL) provides IPv6 [RFC8200] routing services within such
   constraints.  To save signaling and routing state in constrained
   networks, the RPL routing is only performed along a Destination-
   Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) that is optimized to reach a
   Root node, as opposed to along the shortest path between 2 peers,
   whatever that would mean in each LLN.

   This trades the quality of peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly
   reduced amount of control traffic and routing state that would be
   required to operate an any-to-any shortest path protocol.
   Additionally, broken routes may be fixed lazily and on-demand, based
   on dataplane inconsistency discovery, which avoids wasting energy in
   the proactive repair of unused paths.

   The "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol" [RFC4861] [RFC4862]
   was defined for serial links and shared transit media such as
   Ethernet at a time when broadcast was cheap on those media while
   memory for neighbor cache was expensive.  It was thus designed as a
   reactive protocol that relies on caching and multicast operations for
   the Address Resolution (AR, aka Address Discovery or Address Lookup)
   and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) of IPv6 unicast addresses.
   Those multicast operations typically impact every node on-link when
   at most one is really targeted, which is a waste of energy, and imply
   that all nodes are awake to hear the request, which is inconsistent
   with power saving (sleeping) modes.

   The "Architecture and Framework for IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Access"
   (NBMA) [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-over-wireless] introduces an evolution of
   IPv6 ND towards a proactive AR method also called Stateful Address
   Autoconfiguration (SFAAC).  Because the IPv6 model for NBMA depends
   on a routing protocol to reach inside the Subnet, the IPv6 ND
   extension for NBMA is referred to as Subnet Neighbor Discovery (SND).
   SND is based on work done in the context of IoT, known as 6LoWPAN ND.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


   The original 6LoWPAN ND, "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for
   6LoWPAN networks" [RFC6775], was introduced to avoid the excessive
   use of multicast messages and enable IPv6 ND for operations over
   energy-constrained nodes.  [RFC6775] changes the classical IPv6 ND
   model to proactively establish the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE)
   associated to the unicast address of a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) in the a
   6LoWPAN Router(s) (6LRs) that serve it.  To that effect, [RFC6775]
   defines a new Address Registration Option (ARO) that is placed in
   unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA)
   messages between the 6LN and the 6LR.

   "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery" [RFC8505]
   updates [RFC6775] into a generic Address Registration mechanism that
   can be used to access services such as routing and ND proxy and
   introduces the Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) for that
   purpose.  This provides a router-protocol-agnostic interface for a
   host to request that the router inject a unicast IPv6 address in the
   local routing protocol and provide return reachability for that
   address.

   "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Multicast Address Listener Subscription"
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] updates [RFC8505] to enable a
   listener to subscribe to an IPv6 anycast or multicast address; the
   draft also extends [RFC9010] to enable the 6LR to inject the anycast
   and multicast addresses in RPL.  Similarly, this specification
   extends [RFC8505] and [RFC9010] to add the capability for the 6LN to
   register unicast prefixes as opposed to addresses, and to signal in a
   protocol-independent fashion to the 6LR that it is expected to
   redistribute the prefixes in their specific routing protocols.

2.4.  New terms

   This document introduces the following terms:

   Origin  The node that issued the prefix advertisement, either in the
          form of a NS(EARO) or as a DAO(TIO, RTO)
   Merge/merging  The action of receiving multiple anycast or multicast
          advertisements, either internally from self, in the form of a
          NS(EARO), or as a DAO(TIO, RTO), and generating a single
          DAO(TIO, RTO).  The 6RPL router maintains a state per origin
          for each advertised address, and merges the advertisements for
          all subscriptions for the same address in a single
          advertisement.  A RPL router that merges becomes the origin of
          the merged advertisement and uses its own values for the Path
          Sequence and ROVR fields.

3.  Overview

   This specification inherits from [RFC6550], [RFC8505], and [RFC9010]
   to register prefixes as opposed to addresses.  Unless specified
   otherwise therein, the behavior of the 6LBR that acts as RPL Root, of
   the intermediate routers down the RPL graph, of the 6LRs that act as
   access routers and of the 6LNs that are the RPL-unaware destinations,
   is the same as for unicast addresses.  In particular, forwarding a
   packet happens as specified in section 11 of [RFC6550], including
   loop avoidance and detection, though in the case of multicast
   multiple copies might be generated.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


   [RFC8505] is a pre-requisite to this specification.  A node that
   implements this MUST also implement [RFC8505].  This specification
   does not introduce a new option; it modifies existing options and
   updates the associated behaviors to enable the Registration for
   Multicast Addresses as an extension to [RFC8505].

   This specification updates the P field introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] for use in EARO, DAR, and RTO,
   with the new value of 3 to indicate the registration of a prefix, as
   detailed in Section 7.2.  With this extension the 6LNs can now
   attract the traffic for a full prefix, using the P field value of 3
   in the EARO to signal that the registration is for a prefix.
   Multiple 6LNs may register the same prefix to the same 6LR or to
   different 6LRs.

   If the R flag is set in the registration of one or more 6LNs for the
   same prefix, the 6LR is requested to redistribute the prefix in other
   routing protocol (e.g., RPL), based on the longest registration
   lifetime across the active registrations for the prefix.

   This specification extends 6LoWPAN work, and it is certainly possible
   to leverage it between the 6LN and the 6LR where the 6LR is a RPL
   router, as discussed in Section 3.1.  But as for [RFC8505] in
   general, this specification applies, beyond IoT use cases, to
   networks that are not necessarily LLNs, and/or where the routing
   protocol between the 6LR and above is not necessarily RPL.  Examples
   of shared links and hub links are provided in Section 3.2 and
   Section 3.3, respectively.

3.1.  LLN Mesh Network

   This specification also extends [RFC6550] and [RFC9010] in the case
   of a route-over multilink subnet based on the RPL routing protocol,
   to add multicast ingress replication in Non-Storing Mode and anycast
   support in both Storing and Non-Storing modes.  A 6LR that implements
   the RPL extensions specified therein MUST also implement [RFC9010].

   Figure 1 illustrates the classical situation of an LLN as a single
   IPv6 Subnet, with a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) that acts as Root
   for RPL operations and maintains a registry of the active
   registrations as an abstract data structure called an Address
   Registrar for 6LoWPAN ND.

   The LLN may be a hub-and-spoke access link such as (Low-Power) Wi-Fi
   [IEEE80211] and Bluetooth (Low Energy) [IEEE802151], or a Route-Over
   LLN such as the Wi-SUN and 6TiSCH meshes
   [I-D.heile-lpwan-wisun-overview] that leverage 6LoWPAN
   [RFC4919][RFC6282] and RPL [RFC6550] over [IEEE802154].

                          Figure 1: Wireless Mesh

   A leaf acting as a 6LN registers its unicast, multicast, and anycast
   addresses to a RPL router acting as a 6LR, using a layer-2 unicast NS
   message with an EARO as specified in [RFC8505] and
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration].  The registration state is
   periodically renewed by the Registering Node, before the lifetime
   indicated in the EARO expires.  As for unicast IPv6 addresses, the
   6LR uses an EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR to notify the 6LBR of
   the presence of the listeners.  With this specification, a router
   that owns a prefix or provides reachability to an external prefix but
   is not a RPL router can also register those prefixes with the R flag
   set, to enable reachability to the Prefix within the RPL domain.

3.2.  Shared Link

   A shared link is a situation where more than one Prefix is deployed
   over a L2 link (say a switched Ethernet + Wi-Fi ESS), and not
   necessarily all nodes are aware of all prefixes.  Figure 2 depicts
   such a situation, with 2 routers 6LR1 and 6LR2 that own respective
   prefixes P1:: and P2::, and expose those in their RA messages over
   the same link.

                           Figure 2: Shared Link

   Say that 6LR1 is the router providing access to the outside, and 6LR2
   is aware of 6LR1 as its default gateway.  With this specification,
   6LR2 registers P2:: to 6LR1 and 6LR1 installs a route to P2:: via
   6LR2.  This way, addresses that derive from P2:: can still be reached
   via 6LR1 and then 6LR2.  6LR2 may then leverage ICMP Redirect
   messages [RFC4861] to shorten the path between 6LR1 and the nodes
   that own those addresses.

   If P2 was delegated by 6LR1, then the expectation is that 6LR1
   aggregates P1:: and P2:: in its advertisements to the outside, and
   there is no need to set the R flag.  But unless 6LR2 knows about such
   a situation, e.g., through configuration, 6LR2 SHOULD set the R flag
   requesting 6LR1 to advertise P2:: so as to obtain reachability.

3.3.  Hub Link

   A hub link is a situation where stub links are deployed around a hub
   link and interconnected by routers.  Figure 3 depicts such a
   situation, with one router 6LR1 serving the hub link and at least one
   router like 6LR2 and 6LR3 providing connectivity from the stub links
   to the hub link.  In this example, say that there is one prefix on
   each link, P1:: on the hub link and P2:: and P3:: on the stub links.

   As before, say that 6LR1 is the router providing access to the
   outside, and 6LR2 is aware of 6LR1 as its default gateway.  With this
   specification, 6LR2 registers P2:: to 6LR1 and 6LR1 installs a route
   to P2:: via 6LR2.  This way, nodes on the stub link behind 6LR2 that
   derive their addresses from P2:: can still be reached via 6LR1 and
   then 6LR2.  The same goes for 6LR3 and any other routers serving stub
   links.

   If P2 was delegated by 6LR1, then the expectation is that 6LR1
   aggregates P1:: and P2:: in its advertisements to the outside, and
   there is no need to set the R flag.  But unless 6LR2 knows about such
   a situation, e.g., through configuration, 6LR2 SHOULD set the R flag
   requesting 6LR1 to advertise P2:: so as to obtain reachability.

4.  Updating RFC 4861

   [RFC4861] expects that the NS/NA exchange is for a unicast address,
   which is indicated in the Target Address field of the ND message.
   This specification Amends [RFC4861] by allowing a 6LN to advertise a
   prefix in the Target Address field when the NS or NA message is used
   for a registration, per section 5.5 of [RFC8505]; in that case, the
   prefix length is indicated in the EARO of the NS message, overloading
   the field that is used in the NA response for the Status.

5.  Extending RFC 7400

   This specification Extends "6LoWPAN-GHC: Generic Header Compression
   for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)"
   [RFC7400] by defining a new capability bit for use in the 6CIO.
   [RFC7400] was already extended by [RFC8505] for use in IPv6 ND
   messages.

   The new "Registration for prefixes Supported" (F) flag indicates to
   the 6LN that the 6LR accepts IPv6 prefix registrations as specified
   in this document and will ensure that packets for the addresses that
   match this prefix will be routed to the 6LNs that registered the
   prefix, and the route to the prefix will be redistributed if the R
   flag is set to 1.

   Figure 4 illustrates the F flag in its position (7, counting 0 to 15
   in network order in the 16-bit array), to be confirmed by IANA, and
   updated by RFC Editor if needed.

6.  Updating RFC 6550

   [RFC6550] uses the Path Sequence in the Transit Information Option
   (TIO) to retain only the freshest unicast route and remove stale
   ones, e.g., in the case of mobility.  [RFC9010] copies the TID from
   the EARO into the Path Sequence, and the ROVR field into the
   associated RPL Target Option (RTO).  This way, it is possible to
   identify both the registering node and the order of registration in
   RPL for each individual advertisement, so the most recent path and
   lifetime values are used.

   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] requires the use of the ROVR
   field as the indication of the origin of a Target advertisement in
   the RPL DAO messages, as specified in section 6.1 of [RFC9010].  For
   anycast and multicast advertisements (in NS or DAO messages),
   multiple origins may subscribe to the same address, in which case the
   multiple advertisements from the different or unknown origins are
   merged by the common parent; in that case, the common parent becomes
   the origin of the merged advertisements and uses its own ROVR value.
   On the other hand, a parent that propagates an advertisement from a
   single origin uses the original ROVR in the propagated RTO, as it
   does for unicast address advertisements, so the origin is recognized
   across multiple hops.

   This specification Extends [RFC6550] to require that, for prefix
   routes, the Path Sequence is used between and only between
   advertisements for the same Target and from the same origin (i.e.,
   with the same ROVR value); in that case, only the freshest
   advertisement is retained.  But the freshness comparison cannot apply
   if the origin is not determined (i.e., the origin did not support
   this specification).

   [RFC6550] uses the Path Lifetime in the TIO to indicate the remaining
   time for which the advertisement is valid for unicast route
   determination, and a Path Lifetime value of 0 invalidates that route.
   [RFC9010] maps the Address Registration lifetime in the EARO and the
   Path Lifetime in the TIO so they are comparable when both forms of
   advertisements are received.

   The RPL router that merges multiple advertisements for the same
   prefix uses and advertises the longest remaining lifetime across all
   the origins of the advertisements for that prefix.  When the lifetime
   expires, the router sends a no-path DAO (i.e., the lifetime is 0)
   using the same value for ROVR value as for the previous
   advertisements, that is either itself or the single descendant that
   advertised the Target.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


   Note that the Registration Lifetime, TID and ROVR fields are also
   placed in the EDAR message so the state created by EDAR is also
   comparable with that created upon an NS(EARO) or a DAO message.  For
   simplicity the text below mentions only NS(EARO) but applies also to
   EDAR.

7.  Updating RFC 8505

7.1.  New P field value

   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] defines a P-field of 2 bits and
   defines the values 0 to 2, leaving the value of 3 reserved.  This
   specification adds a new value to the P field to signal that the
   Registered Address is a prefix.  The receiver installs a route to the
   prefix via the sender's address used as source address in the
   NS(EARO) registration message.

   This specification assigns the value of 3, resulting in the complete
   table as follows:

             +-------+--------------------------------------+
             | Value | Meaning                              |
             +-------+--------------------------------------+
             | 0     | Registration for a Unicast Address   |
             +-------+--------------------------------------+
             | 1     | Registration for a Multicast Address |
             +-------+--------------------------------------+
             | 2     | Registration for an Anycast Address  |
             +-------+--------------------------------------+
             | 3     | Registration for a Unicast prefix    |
             +-------+--------------------------------------+

                         Table 1: P-field Values

7.2.  New EARO Prefix Length Field and F Flag

   Section 4.1 of [RFC8505] defines the EARO as an extension to the ARO
   option defined in [RFC6775].

   The Status Field that is used only when the EARO is placed in an NA
   message.  This specification repurposes that field to carry the
   prefix length (plen) when the EARO is placed in an NS message as
   illustrated in Figure 5.  The plen is expressed as 7 bits and the
   most significant bit of the field is reserved.  A 7-bit value of 0 is
   understood as a truncated 128, meaning that this registration is for
   an address as opposed to a prefix.  This approach is backward
   compatible with [RFC8505] and spans both addresses and prefixes.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


   This specification adds a new F flag to signal that the Registered
   Prefix is topologically correct through the Registering Node.  This
   means that the Registering Node can relay packets that are sourced in
   the Registered Prefix to the outside, and the packets will be not be
   filtered by the application of [BCP38].  The receiver forwards
   packets to the Registering Node address when the source address of
   the packets derives from the Registered Prefix.  Note that to avoid
   loops, the receiver must be in the inside so packets sent by the
   sender towards the outside may never reach the receiver.  The notion
   of inside and outside are administratively defined, e.g., inside is a
   particular Layer-2 network such as an Ethernet fabric.

   When the F flag is not set, the Registering Node owns the prefix and
   will deliver packets to the destination if the destination address
   derives from the prefix.  Conversely, if the F flag is set, the
   Registering Node will forward traffic whose source address derives
   from the Registered Prefix into a network location (e.g., to an ISP
   Provider Edge) where this source address is topologically correct
   (e.g., derives from a prefix assigned by that ISP).  The F flag is
   encoded in the most significant bit of the EARO status field when the
   status field is used to transport a Prefix Length as shown in
   Figure 5.

      routers to forward packets to self when the packets are sourced
      with the registered prefix.

7.3.  New EDAR Prefix Length Field

   This specification adds the new value of 3 to the P field to signal
   that the Registered Address is a prefix.  When that is the case, the
   prefix is assumed to be less than 120 bits long, padded with zeros up
   to 120 bits, and the remaining 8 bits are dedicated to the prefix
   length.

   Figure 6 illustrates the EDAR message when the value of the P field
   is 3.

7.4.  Registering Extensions

   With [RFC8505]:

   *  A router that expects to reboot may send a final RA message, upon
      which nodes should register elsewhere or redo the registration to
      the same router upon reboot.  In all other cases, a node reboot is
      silent.  When the node comes back to life, existing registration
      state might be lost if it was not persisted, e.g., in persistent
      memory.

   *  Only unicast addresses can be registered.

   *  The 6LN must register all its ULA and GUA with a NS(EARO).

   *  The 6LN may set the R flag in the EARO to obtain return
      reachability services by the 6LR, e.g., through ND proxy
      operations, or by injecting the route in a route-over subnet.

   *  The 6LR maintains a registration state per Registered Address,
      including an NCE with the Link Layer Address (LLA) of the
      Registered Node (the 6LN here).

   This specification adds the following behavior, similar to that
   introduced by [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] for multicast
   addresses:

   *  The operation for registering prefixes is similar as for addresses
      from the perspective of the 6LN, but shows important differences
      on the router side, which maintains a separate state for each
      origin and merges them in its own advertisements.

   *  The ARO Status indicating a "Registration Refresh Request" applies
      to prefixes as well.

      This status is used in asynchronous NA(EARO) messages to indicate
      to peer 6LNs that they are requested to reregister all addresses
      and prefixes that were previously registered to the originating
      node.  The NA message MAY be sent to a unicast or a multicast
      link-scope address and SHOULD be contained within the L2 range
      where nodes may effectively have registered/subscribed to this
      router, e.g., a radio broadcast domain to preserve energy and
      spectrum.

      A device that wishes to refresh its state, e.g., upon reboot if it
      may have lost some registration state, SHOULD send an asynchronous
      NA(EARO) with this new status value.  That asynchronous NA(ARO)
      SHOULD be sent to the all-nodes link scope multicast address

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


      (FF02::1) and Target MUST be set to the link local address that
      was exposed previously by this node to accept registrations, and
      the TID MUST be set to 0.

      In an unreliable environment, the multicast NA(EARO) message may
      be resent in a fast sequence, in which case the TID is incremented
      each time.  A 6LN that has recently processed the NA(ARO) ignores
      the NA(EARO) with a newer TID received within the duration of the
      fast sequence.  That duration depends on the environment and has
      to be configured.  By default, it is of 10 seconds.

   *  Registration for prefixes is now supported.  The value of 3 in the
      P field of the EARO and the EDAR message signals when the
      registration is for a prefix as opposed to an address.  DAD for
      prefixes and addresses becomes a prefix overlap match.  Whether
      overlapping addresses and prefixes may be registered is a network
      policy decision and out of scope.  The same prefix may be injected
      twice (multiple routes) as long as they use the same value of the
      ROVR.

      Overlaps may be desirable.  It may happen for instance that a
      proxy registers a prefix while a host using an address from that
      prefix also registers.  It might also occur that an aggregated
      prefix is owned as a catch all, and subdivided into subnets that
      are allocated to and then registered by other nodes.

      In case of an overlapping registration, the longest match wins,
      meaning that if the network policy allows for overlapping
      registrations, then the routes for the registered prefixes are
      installed towards the node that registered with the longest match,
      all the way to /128.

   *  If the 6LR acts as a router to prefixes or owns the prefixes
      entirely, it SHOULD register all those prefixes on all interfaces
      from which it might be needed to relay traffic to that prefix, and
      it MUST set the P field in the EARO to 3 for those prefixes.

   *  The 6LN MAY set the R flag in the EARO to request the 6LR to
      redistribute the prefix on other links using a routing protocol.
      The 6LR MUST NOT reregister that prefix to yet another router as
      it may create a loop.

   *  The 6LR and the 6LBR are extended to accept more than one
      registration for the same prefix, since multiple 6LNs may register
      it.  The Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR) in the EARO
      identifies uniquely a registration within the namespace of the
      Registered Prefix.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


   *  The 6LR MUST maintain a registration state per tuple (IPv6 prefix/
      length, ROVR) for all registered prefixes.  It SHOULD notify the
      6LBR with an EDAR message, unless it determined that the 6LBR is
      legacy and does not support this specification (see Section 5).
      In turn, the 6LBR MUST maintain a registration state per tuple
      (IPv6 prefix, ROVR) for all prefixes.

8.  Updating RFC 9010

   With [RFC9010]:

   *  The 6LR injects only unicast routes in RPL.

   *  Upon a registration with the R flag set to 1 in the EARO, the 6LR
      injects the address in the RPL unicast support.

   *  Upon receiving a packet directed to a unicast address for which it
      has an active registration, the 6LR delivers the packet as a
      unicast layer-2 frame to the LLA of the node that registered the
      unicast address.

   This specification adds the following behavior:

   *  Upon a registration with the R flag set to 1 and the P field set
      to 3 in the EARO, the 6LR injects the prefix in RPL using a prefix
      RTO.  The P field in the RTP MUST be set to 3.


   *  Upon receiving a packet directed to an address that derives from a
      prefix for which it has at least one registration, the 6LR
      delivers a copy of the packet as a unicast layer-2 frame to the
      LLA of exactly one of the nodes that registered to that prefix,
      using the longest match derivation to find the best 6LN.

9.  Updating RFC 8928

   Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
   [RFC8928] was defined to protect the ownership of unicast IPv6
   addresses that are registered with [RFC8505].

   With [RFC8928], it is possible for a node to autoconfigure a pair of
   public and private keys and use them to sign the registration of
   addresses that are either autoconfigured or obtained through other
   methods.

   The first hop router (the 6LR) can then validate a registration and
   perform source address validation on packets coming from the sender
   node (the 6LN).

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration             November 2024


   Prefixes are not always owned by one node.  Multiple nodes may
   register the same prefix.  In that context, the method specified in
   [RFC8928] cannot be used with node-local autoconfigured keypairs
   which protect a single ownership only.

   For a prefix, as for an anycast or a multicast address, it is still
   possible to leverage [RFC8928] to enforce the right to register.  If
   [RFC8928] is used, a keypair MUST be created and associated with the
   prefix before the prefix is deployed, and a ROVR MUST be generated
   from that keypair as specified in [RFC8928].  The prefix and the ROVR
   MUST then be installed in the 6LBR at the first registration, or by
   an external mechanism such as IP Address Management (IPAM) or DHCPv6
   snooping prior to the first registration.  This way, the 6LBR can
   recognize the prefix on the future registrations and validate the
   right to register based on the ROVR.

   The keypair MUST then be provisioned in each node that needs to
   register the prefix or a prefix within, so the node can follow the
   steps in [RFC8928] to register the prefix.

   Upon receiving an NA Message with the status set to 5 "Validation
   Requested", the node that registered the address or prefix performs
   the proof of ownership based on that longest match.

10.  Security Considerations

   This specification extends [RFC8505], and the security section of
   that document also applies to this document.  In particular, the link
   layer SHOULD be sufficiently protected to prevent rogue access.

   Section 9 leverages [RFC8928] to prevent a rogue node to register a
   unicast address that it does not own.  The mechanism could be
   extended to anycast and multicast addresses if the values of the ROVR
   they use is known in advance, but how this is done is not in scope
   for this specification.  One way would be to authorize in advance the
   ROVR of the valid users.  A less preferred way could be to
   synchronize the ROVR and TID values across the valid registering
   nodes as a preshared key material.

   In the latter case, it could be possible to update the keys
   associated to a prefix in all the 6LNs, but the flow is not clearly
   documented and may not complete in due time for all nodes in LLN use
   cases.  It may be simpler to install an all-new address with new keys
   over a period of time, and switch the traffic to that address when
   the migration is complete.

11.  Backward Compatibility

   A legacy 6LN will not register prefixes and the service will be the
   same when the network is upgraded.  A legacy 6LR will not set the F
   flag in the 6CIO and an upgraded 6LN will not register prefixes.

   Upon an EDAR message, a legacy 6LBR may not realize that the address
   being registered is anycast or multicast, and return that it is
   duplicate in the EDAC status.  The 6LR MUST ignore a duplicate status
   in the EDAR for anycast and multicast addresses.

12.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor, to be removed: please replace "This RFC"
   throughout this document by the RFC number for this specification
   once it is allocated.

   IANA is requested to make changes under the "Internet Control Message
   Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters" [IANA.ICMP] and the "Routing
   Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)" [IANA.RPL] registry
   groupings, as follows:

12.1.  Updated P-Field Registry

   This specification updates the P field introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] to assign the value of 3, which
   is the only remaining unassigned value for the 2-bit field.  To that
   effect, IANA is requested to update the "P-field values" registry
   under the heading "Internet Control Message Protocol version 6
   (ICMPv6) Parameters" as indicated in Table 2:

             +-------+---------------------------+-----------+
             | Value | Meaning                   | Reference |
             +-------+---------------------------+-----------+
             | 3     | Registration for a prefix | This RFC  |
             +-------+---------------------------+-----------+

                         Table 2: New P-field value

12.2.  New 6LoWPAN Capability Bit

   IANA is requested to make an addition to the "6LoWPAN Capability
   Bits" [IANA.ICMP.6CIO] registry under the heading "Internet Control
   Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters" as indicated in
   Table 3:
