    This document updates IPv6 Neighbor Discovery RFC4861 and the 6LoWPAN
    extensions (RFC8505, RFC8928, RFC8929, RFC7400) to enable a node that owns or is directly
    connected to a prefix to register that prefix to neighbor routers. The
    registration indicates that the registered prefix can be reached via the
    advertising node without a loop.
    The unicast prefix registration allows to request neighbor router(s) 
    to redistribute the prefix in a larger routing domain regardless 
    of the routing protocol used in the larger domain.
    This document extends RPL (RFC6550, RFC6553, RFC9010) to enable the 6LR to
    inject  the registered prefix in RPL.

<section anchor="introduction"> <name>Introduction</name>

<t>The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused on
   saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. Other design
   constraints, such as a limited memory capacity, duty cycling of the LLN
   devices and low-power lossy transmissions, derive from that primary concern.
   The radio (both transmitting or simply listening) is a major energy drain
   and the LLN protocols must be adapted to allow the nodes to remain sleeping
   with the radio turned off at most times.
   
</t> <t>
	Examples of LLNs include hub-and-spoke access links such as (Low-Power) Wi-Fi
   <xref target="IEEE80211"/> and Bluetooth (Low Energy)
   <xref target="IEEE802151"/>, Mesh-Under networks where the routing
   operation is handled at Layer-2, and Route-Over networks such as the Wi-SUN 
   <xref target="WI-SUN"/> and 6TiSCH <xref target="RFC9030"/>
   mesh networks, which leverage 6LoWPAN <xref target="RFC4919"/><xref target="RFC6282"/>
   and RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> over <xref target="IEEE802154"/>.
 
</t><t>
   LLNs and constrained devices are the original domain of application
   for 6LoWPAN protocols.  It is thus a foremost concern, when designing
   those protocols, to minimize energy spendings.  In non-LLN
   environments where lowering carbon emissions is also a priority, it
   could make sense to apply the 6LoWPAN designs and extend some of the
   6LoWPAN protocols.    The general design points include:
  
</t>
<ul>
   <li>
     Placing the protocol complexity in the less-constrained routers to simplify the host implementation and avoid expanding the control traffic to all nodes.
   </li>
   
   <li>
    Using host-stimulated operations to enable transient disconnections with the routers, e.g., 
	 to conserve power (sleep), but also to cope with inconsistent connectivity.
	 </li>
  

</ul>

   <t>
     This translates into: 
	 
   </t>
   
<ul>
   <li>Stateful proactively-built knowledge in the routers that is available at any point of time.
	</li>
   
   <li>
    Unicast host to router operations stimulated by the host and its applications.
	</li>
   
   <li>
    Minimal use of asynchronous L2-broadcast operations that would keep the host awake and listening with no application-level need to do so.
   </li>
  

</ul>
   
   
<t>
   The <xref target="RFC6550">"Routing Protocol for Low Power
   and Lossy Networks"</xref> (RPL) provides IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200"/>
   routing services within such constraints.
   To save signaling and routing state in constrained networks, the RPL routing
   is only performed along a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG)
   that is optimized to reach a Root node, as opposed to along the shortest path
   between 2 peers, whatever that would mean in each LLN.
</t><t>
   The classical Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol
   <xref target="RFC4861"/> <xref target="RFC4862"/> was defined for serial
   links and shared transit media such as Ethernet at a time when L2-broadcast
   was cheap on those media while memory for neighbor cache was expensive.
   It was thus designed as a reactive protocol that relies on caching and
   multicast operations for the Address Resolution (AR, aka Address Discovery or
   Address Lookup) and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) of IPv6 unicast addresses.
   Those multicast operations typically impact every node on-link when at most
   one is really targeted, which is a waste of energy, and imply that all
   nodes are awake to hear the request, which is inconsistent with power
   saving (sleeping) modes.
</t><t>
   The <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-over-wireless">
   "Architecture and Framework for IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Access" (NBMA)</xref>
   introduces an evolution of IPv6 ND towards a proactive AR method.
   Because the IPv6 model for
   NBMA depends on a routing protocol to reach inside the Subnet, the
   IPv6 ND extension for NBMA is referred to as Subnet Neighbor Discovery (SND).
   SND is based on work done in the context of IoT, known as 6LoWPAN ND.
   As opposed to the classical IPv6 ND Protocol, this evolution follows the 
   energy conservation principles discussed above:

</t>
<ul><li>
   The original 6LoWPAN ND, <xref target="RFC6775"> "Neighbor Discovery
   Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks"</xref>, was introduced to avoid the
   excessive use of multicast messages and enable IPv6 ND for operations over
   energy-constrained nodes.
   <xref target="RFC6775"/> changes the classical IPv6 ND model to proactively
   establish the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) associated to the unicast address of
   a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) in the a 6LoWPAN Router(s) (6LRs) that serve it.
   To that effect, <xref target="RFC6775"/> defines a new Address Registration
   Option (ARO) that is  placed in unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and
   Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between the 6LN and the 6LR.
</li><li>
   <xref target="RFC8505"> "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor
   Discovery"</xref> updates <xref target="RFC6775"/> into a generic Address
   Registration mechanism that can be used to access services such as routing
   and ND proxy <xref target="RFC8929"/> and introduces the Extended Address Registration Option (EARO)
   for that purpose. This provides a routing-protocol-agnostic method for a host to
   request that the router injects a unicast IPv6 address in the local routing
   protocol and provide return reachability for that address.
</li><li>
   <xref target="RFC9685">
   "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Multicast Address Listener Subscription"</xref>
   updates <xref target="RFC8505"/> to enable a listener to subscribe to an IPv6
    anycast or multicast address; the draft also extends <xref target="RFC9010"/>
    to enable the 6LR to inject the anycast and multicast addresses in RPL.
    Similarly, this specification extends <xref target="RFC8505"/> and
    <xref target="RFC9010"/> to add the capability for the 6LN to register unicast
    prefixes as opposed to addresses, and to signal in a routing-protocol-independent
    fashion to the 6LR that it is expected to redistribute the prefixes.
</li></ul>
<t>
This specification extends the above registration and subscription methods
to enable a node to register a unicast prefix to the routing system and get it injected in the routing protocol. As with <xref target="RFC8505"/>, the prefix registration is agnostic to the routing protocol in which the router injects the prefix, and the router is agnostic to the method that was used to allocate the prefix to the node.
The energy conservation principles in <xref target="RFC8505"/> are retained as well, 
meaning that the node does not have to send or expect asynchronous multicast messages. 

</t><t>
It can be noted that an energy-conserving node is not necessarily a router, so even when advertising a prefix, it is a design choice not to use Router Advertisement (RA) messages that would make the node appear as a router to peer nodes. From the design principles above, it is clearly a design choice not to leverage broadcasts from or to the node, or complex state machines in the node. It is also a design choice to use and extend the EARO as opposed to the  Route Information Option (RIO) <xref target="RFC4191"/> because the RIO is not intended to inject routes in routing, and is lacking related control information like the R bit in the EARO. Additionally, an RA with RIO cannot be trusted for a safe injection in the routing protocol for the lack of the equivalent of the Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR) <xref target="RFC8928"/> in the EARO.

       <dt>Origin</dt><dd> The node that issued the prefix

<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>
   <t>
   This specification inherits from <xref target="RFC6550"/>,
   <xref target="RFC8505"/>, and <xref target="RFC9010"/> to register prefixes as opposed to addresses. Unless specified otherwise therein,
   the behavior of the 6LBR that acts as RPL Root, of the intermediate routers
   down the RPL graph, of the 6LRs that act as access routers and of the 6LNs
   that are the RPL-unaware destinations, is the same as for unicast addresses.
   In particular, forwarding a packet happens as specified in section 11 of
   <xref target="RFC6550"/>, including loop avoidance and detection, though in
   the case of multicast multiple copies might be generated.
   </t>
   <t><xref target="RFC8505"/> is a pre-requisite to this specification.
   A node that implements this MUST also implement <xref target="RFC8505"/>.
   This specification does not introduce a new option; it modifies
   existing options and updates the associated behaviors to enable the
   Registration for Multicast Addresses as an extension to
   <xref target="RFC8505"/>.
   </t>

<t>
   This specification updates the P field introduced in <xref target=
   "RFC9685"/> for use in EARO, DAR, and RTO,
   with the new value of 3 to indicate the registration of a prefix, as
   detailed in <xref target="R8505E"/>.
   With this extension, the 6LN can now express its willingness to receive the traffic for all addresses in the range of a prefix, using the P field value of 3 in the EARO to signal that the
   registration is for such prefix. Multiple 6LNs acting as border routers to the same external network or as access routers to the same subnet may register the same prefix to the same 6LR or to different 6LRs.
</t><t>
   If the R flag is set in the registration of one or more 6LNs for the same
   prefix, then, according to its redistribution policy, the 6LR MUST 
   redistribute the prefix in the routing protocol(s) (e.g., RPL) that 
   it participates to. The duration of the redistribution is   
   based on the longest registration lifetime across the
   non-expired received registrations for the prefix.
</t><t>
    Examples of use-cases where this specification may apply include virtual links, shared links,
    and hub links as shown in <xref target="Shared"/> and <xref target="Hub"/>, respectively.
    More generally, the 6LN may be a router running a different routing protocol in an 
    external network, e.g., a stub network, and acting as a border router. 
    Using the prefix registration method enables to decouple the routing 
    protocol in the 6LN from the routing protocol that the 6LRs run in the main LLN
    and provide signaling to stimulate the redistribution.
</t>
<section anchor="LLN"><name>RPL-Based Route-Over LLNs</name>
   <t>
   This specification also extends <xref target="RFC6550"/> and
   <xref target="RFC9010"/> in the case of a route-over multilink subnet based
   on the RPL routing protocol, to add multicast ingress replication in
   Non-Storing Mode and anycast support in both Storing and Non-Storing modes.
   A 6LR that implements the RPL extensions specified therein MUST also
   implement <xref target="RFC9010"/>.
   </t>
    <t>
    <xref target="figref"/> illustrates the classical situation of an LLN as a
    single IPv6 Subnet, with a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) that acts as Root
    for RPL operations and as Address Registrar for 6LowPAN ND.

<t>
   A RPL leaf L acting as a 6LN registers its addresses and prefixes 
   to a RPL router acting as a 6LR, using a layer-2 unicast NS message
   with an EARO as specified in <xref target="RFC8505"/> and <xref target=
   "RFC9685"/>. 
   Note that a RPL leaf acting as 6LN may still be a border router for another
   routing protocol, an access router for an IP link, or a virtual Router
   serving virtual machines or applications within the same physical node.
   Note also that a RPL-aware Leaf would preferably leverage RPL directly
   to inject routes, to fully leverage the routing protocol.
   The registration state is periodically renewed by the Registering Node (the 6LN),
   before the lifetime indicated in the EARO expires (at the 6LR). As for unicast IPv6
   addresses, the 6LR uses an EDAR/EDAC  exchange with the 6LBR to notify the
   6LBR of the presence of the listeners.
   With this specification, a router that owns a prefix or provides reachability
   to an external prefix but is not a RPL router can also register those
   prefixes with the R flag set, to enable reachability  to the Prefix
   within the RPL domain.

<section anchor="Shared"><name>Shared Link</name>

<t>
    A shared link is a situation where more than one prefix is deployed over
    a L2 link (say a switched Ethernet fabric, or a Wi-Fi Extended Service Set (ESS) federating multiple Access Points),
    and not necessarily all nodes are aware of all prefixes. <xref target="figshared"/> depicts such
    a situation, with 2 routers 6LR1 and 6LR2 that own respective prefixes P1::
    and P2::, and expose those in their RA messages over the same link.
    Note that the shared link maybe operated with any combination of NDP and SND 
    as discussed in section 7 of  <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-over-wireless"/>.

<t>
    Say that 6LR1 is the router providing access to the outside, and 6LR2 is
    aware of 6LR1 as its default gateway. With this specification, 6LR2
    registers P2:: to 6LR1 and 6LR1 installs a route to P2:: via 6LR2. This way,
    addresses that derive from P2:: can still be reached via 6LR1 and then 6LR2.
    
    6LR2 may then leverage ICMP Redirect	messages <xref target="RFC4861"/> to shorten the
    path between 6LR1 and the nodes	  that own those addresses.
    </t>

<t> If P2 was delegated by 6LR1, e.g., using the <xref target="RFC8415">
    "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6" </xref> (DHCPv6), 
    then the expectation is that 6LR1 aggregates
    P1:: and P2:: in its advertisements to the outside, and there is no need to
    set the R flag. But unless 6LR2 knows about such a situation, e.g., through
    configuration, 6LR2 SHOULD set the R flag requesting
    6LR1 to advertise P2:: so as to obtain reachability.

    A hub link is a situation where stub links are deployed around a hub link and
    interconnected by routers. <xref target="fighub"/> depicts such
    a situation, with one router 6LR1 serving the hub link and at least one
    router like 6LR2 and 6LR3 providing connectivity from the stub links to the
    hub link. In this example, say that there is one prefix on each link,
    P1:: on the hub link and P2:: and P3:: on the stub links.

<t>
    As before, say that 6LR1 is the router providing access to the outside, and
    6LR2 is aware of 6LR1 as its default gateway. With this specification, 6LR2
    registers P2:: to 6LR1 and 6LR1 installs a route to P2:: via 6LR2. This way,
    nodes on the stub link behind 6LR2 that derive their addresses from P2:: can
    still be reached via 6LR1 and then 6LR2. The same goes for 6LR3 and any other
    routers serving stub links.
</t><t>
    If P2 was delegated by 6LR1, then the expectation is that 6LR1 aggregates
    P1:: and P2:: in its advertisements to the outside, and there is no need to
    set the R flag. But unless 6LR2 knows about such a situation, e.g., through
    configuration, 6LR2 SHOULD set the R flag requesting
    6LR1 to advertise P2:: so as to obtain reachability.
</t><t>
    In this example, routers 6LR3 and 6LR4 both connect to the same stub link where subnet P3 is installed.
    They may both register P3 to 6LR1, and 6LR1 will apply its own load balancing logic to use
    either of the routers.

   <xref target="RFC4861"/> expects that the NS/NA exchange is for a unicast
   address, which is indicated in the Target Address field of the ND message.
   This specification Amends <xref target="RFC4861"/> by allowing a 6LN to advertise a
   prefix in the Target Address field when the NS or NA message is used for a
   registration, per section 5.5 of <xref target="RFC8505"/>; in that case, the
   prefix length is indicated in the EARO of the NS message, overloading the
   field that is used in the NA response for the Status.

   The new "Registration for prefixes Supported" (F) flag indicates

<section anchor="coex"><name>Updating RFC 6550</name>
<t>
   <xref target="RFC6550"/> uses the Path Sequence in the Transit Information
   Option (TIO) to retain only the freshest unicast route and remove stale ones,
   e.g., in the case of mobility. <xref target="RFC9010"/> copies the TID from
   the EARO into the Path Sequence, and the ROVR field into the associated RPL
   Target Option (RTO).
   This way, it is possible to identify both the registering node and the
   order of registration in RPL for each individual advertisement, so the
   most recent path and lifetime values are used.
</t><t>

   <xref target="RFC9685"/> requires the use of the
   ROVR field as the indication of the origin of a Target advertisement in the
   RPL DAO messages, as specified in section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC9010"/>.
   For anycast and multicast advertisements (in NS or DAO messages), multiple
   origins may subscribe to the same address, in which case the multiple
   advertisements from the different or unknown origins are merged by the common
   parent; in that case, the common parent becomes the origin of the merged
   advertisements and uses its own ROVR value. On the other hand, a parent that
   propagates an advertisement from a single origin uses the original ROVR in
   the propagated RTO, as it does for unicast address advertisements, so the
   origin is recognized across multiple hops.

</t><t>
   This specification Extends <xref target="RFC6550"/> to require that,
   for prefix routes, the Path Sequence is used between and only between
   advertisements for the same Target and from the same origin (i.e., with the same ROVR value); in that case, only the freshest advertisement is retained. But the freshness comparison cannot apply if the
   origin is not determined (i.e., the origin did not support this specification).
</t><t>
   <xref target="RFC6550"/> uses the Path Lifetime in the TIO to indicate the
   remaining time for which the advertisement is valid for unicast route
   determination, and a Path Lifetime value of 0 invalidates that route.
   <xref target="RFC9010"/> maps the Address Registration lifetime in the EARO
   and the Path Lifetime in the TIO so they are comparable when both forms of
   advertisements are received.
</t><t>
   The RPL router that merges multiple advertisements for the same prefix 
   uses and advertises the longest remaining lifetime
   across all the origins of the advertisements for that prefix.
   When the lifetime expires, the router sends a no-path DAO (i.e., the lifetime
   is 0) using the same value for ROVR value as for the previous advertisements,
   that is either itself or the single descendant that advertised the Target.
</t><t>

   Note that the Registration Lifetime, TID and ROVR fields are also placed in
   the EDAR message so the state created by EDAR is also comparable with that created upon an NS(EARO) or a DAO message. For simplicity the text below
   mentions only NS(EARO) but applies also to EDAR.

<section anchor="updating"><name>Updating RFC 8505</name>




<section anchor="R8505EF"><name>New P field value</name>
<t> <xref target="RFC9685"/> defines a P-Field
   of 2 bits and defines the values 0 to 2, leaving the value of 3 reserved.
   This specification adds a new value to the P field to signal that the
   Registered Address is a prefix. The receiver installs a route to the
   prefix via the sender's address used as source address in the NS(EARO)
   registration message.

</t>

<section anchor="R8505E"><name>New EARO Prefix Length Field and F Flag</name>

<t>
   Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC8505"/> defines the EARO as an extension to
   the ARO option defined in <xref target="RFC6775"/>.

</t>
<t>
  The Status Field that is used only when the EARO is placed in an NA message.
  This specification repurposes that field to carry the prefix length 
  when the EARO is placed in an NS message as illustrated in <xref target="EARO"/>.
  The prefix length is expressed as 7 bits and the most significant bit of the field
  is reserved. A 7-bit value of 0 is understood as a truncated 128, meaning that
  this registration is for an address as opposed to a prefix.
  This approach is backward compatible with <xref target="RFC8505"/> and spans
  both addresses and prefixes.
  </t>

<t>
   This specification adds a new F flag to signal that the Registered Prefix
   is topologically correct through the Registering Node. This means that the
   Registering Node relays packets that are sourced in the Registered Prefix
   to the outside, in accordance with
   <xref target="RFC2827">"Network Ingress Filtering"</xref> .
   The receiver forwards packets to the Registering Node
   address when the source address of the packets derives from the Registered Prefix.
   Note that to avoid loops, the receiver must be in the inside so packets
   sent by the sender towards the outside may never reach the receiver.
   The notion of inside and outside are administratively defined, e.g., inside
   is a particular Layer-2 network such as an Ethernet fabric.
</t>
<t>

   When the F flag is not set, the Registering Node owns the prefix and will
   deliver packets to the destination if the destination address derives
   from the prefix. Conversely, if the F flag is set, the Registering Node will
   forward traffic whose source address derives from the Registered Prefix into
   a network location (e.g., to an ISP Provider Edge) where this source address
   is topologically correct (e.g., derives from a prefix assigned by that ISP).
   The F flag is encoded in the most significant bit of the EARO status field
   when the status field is used to transport a Prefix Length as shown in
   <xref target="EARO"/>.

<section anchor="multireg"><name>Registering Extensions</name>
<t>
   With <xref target="RFC8505"/>:
   </t>
<ul>
   <li>
   A router that expects to reboot may send a final RA message, upon which
   nodes should register elsewhere or redo the registration to the same router
   upon reboot.
   In all other cases, a node reboot is silent.
   When the node comes back to life, existing registration
   state might be lost if it was not safely stored, e.g., in persistent memory.
   </li>
   <li>
   Only unicast addresses can be registered.
   </li>
   <li>
   The 6LN must register all its ULA and GUA with a NS(EARO).
   </li>
   <li>
   The 6LN may set the R flag in the EARO to obtain return reachability services by the 6LR, e.g., through ND proxy operations, or by injecting the route in a route-over subnet.
   </li>
   <li>
   The 6LR maintains a registration state per Registered Address, including an
   NCE with the Link Layer Address (LLA) of the Registered Node (the 6LN here).
   </li>
   </ul>
   <t>
   The operation for registering prefixes is similar as for addresses from the
   perspective of the 6LN, but shows important differences on the router side,
   which maintains a separate state for each origin and merges them in its own
   advertisements. This specification adds the following behavior, similar to that introduced
   by <xref target="RFC9685"/> for multicast addresses:
  </t>
   <ul>

   <li>
   <t>
   The ARO Status indicating a "Registration Refresh Request" applies to prefixes
   as well.
   </t>
   <t>
   This status is used in asynchronous NA(EARO) messages to indicate to peer 6LNs
   that they are requested to reregister all addresses and prefixes that were
   previously registered to the originating node. The NA message MAY be sent to
   a unicast or a multicast link-scope address and SHOULD be contained within
   the L2 range where nodes may effectively have registered/subscribed to this
   router, e.g., a radio broadcast domain to preserve energy and spectrum.
   </t>
   <t>
   A device that wishes to refresh its state, e.g., upon reboot if it may have
   lost some registration state, SHOULD send an asynchronous NA(EARO) with this
   new status value. That asynchronous NA(ARO) SHOULD be sent to the all-nodes
   link-scope multicast address (ff02::1) and Target MUST be set to the 
   link-local address that was exposed previously by this node to accept 
   registrations, and the TID MUST be set to 0.
   </t>
   <t>
   In an environment with unreliable transmissions, the multicast NA(EARO) 
   message may be resent in a fast sequence, in which case the TID is incremented each time.
   A 6LN that has recently
   processed the NA(EARO)  indicating a "Registration Refresh Request"
   ignores the additional NA(EARO) also 
   indicating a "Registration Refresh Request" within the duration of 
   the fast sequence. That duration depends on the
   environment and has to be configured. By default, it is of 10 seconds.
   </t>
   </li>
   <li>
   <t>
   Registration for prefixes is now supported. The value of 3 in the P field of
   the EARO and the EDAR message signals when the registration is for a prefix
   as opposed to an address. DAD for prefixes and addresses becomes a prefix
   overlap match. Whether overlapping addresses and prefixes may be registered
   is a network policy decision and out of scope.
   The same prefix may be injected twice (multiple routes) as long as they use
   the same value of the ROVR.
   </t>
   <t>
   Overlaps may be desirable. It may happen for instance that a router or a 
   proxy (see <xref target="ext8929"/>) registers a prefix or an aggregation
   while a host using an address from that prefix or a prefix from that 
   aggregation also registers its piece.
   </t>
   <t>
   In case of an overlapping registration, the longest prefix match wins, meaning that
   if the  network policy allows for overlapping registrations, then the
   routes for the registered prefixes are installed towards the node that
   registered with  the longest prefix match, all the way to /128.
   </t>
   </li>
   <li>
   If the 6LR acts as a border router to external prefixes or owns the prefixes entirely, it
   SHOULD register all those prefixes with on all interfaces from which it might
   be needed to relay traffic to that prefix. It MUST set the P field in the
   EARO to 3 for those prefixes, and the set R flag to receive the traffic 
   associated to the prefixes. It MAY refrain from registering a prefix
   on one interface if that prefix is already successfully registered on
   another interface, or the router handled the EDAR / EDAC flow by itself,
   to ensure that the prefix ownership is known and validated by the 6LBR. 
   Additionally, if the router expect to receive traffic for that prefix on that
   interface, it needs to ensure that the prefix is advertised some other way, 
   e.g., over a routing protocol such as RPL.
   </li>
   <li>
   The 6LN MAY set the R flag in the EARO to request the 6LR to redistribute
   the prefix on other links using a routing protocol. The 6LR MUST NOT
   reregister that prefix to yet another router unless loops are avoided some way,
   e.g., following a tree structure.
   </li>
   <li>
   The 6LR and the 6LBR are extended to accept more than one registration for
   the same prefix, since multiple 6LNs may register it. The Registration
   Ownership Verifier (ROVR) in the EARO identifies uniquely a registration
   within the namespace of the Registered Prefix.
   </li>
   <li>
    The 6LR MUST maintain a registration state per tuple (IPv6 prefix/length, ROVR)
    for all registered prefixes. It SHOULD notify the 6LBR

	not support this specification (see <xref target="CIO"/>). In turn, the 6LBR MUST maintain a
    registration state per tuple (IPv6 prefix, ROVR) for all prefixes.

<section anchor="updating2"><name>Updating RFC 9010</name>
<t>
   With <xref target="RFC9010"/>:
   </t>
   <ul>
   <li>
   The 6LR injects only unicast routes in RPL.
   </li>
   <li>
   Upon a registration with the R flag set to 1 in the EARO, the 6LR injects the address in the RPL unicast support.
   </li>
   <li>
   Upon receiving a packet directed to a unicast address for which it has an
   active registration, the 6LR delivers the packet as a unicast layer-2 frame
   to the LLA of the node that registered the unicast address.
   </li>
   </ul>
   <t>
   This specification adds the following behavior:
   </t>
   <ul>
   <li>
   Upon a registration with the R flag set to 1 and the P field set to 3 in the EARO, the 6LR injects the prefix in RPL using a prefix RTO.
   The P field in the RTP MUST be set to 3.
   
   </li><li>
   Upon receiving a packet directed to an address that derives from a prefix for
   which it has at least one registration, the 6LR delivers a copy of the packet
   as a unicast layer-2 frame to the LLA of exactly one of the nodes that
   registered to that prefix, using the longest prefix match derivation to find the
   best 6LN.
   </li>
   </ul>

<section  anchor="sec8928"><name>Updating RFC 8928</name>
<t>
    <xref target="RFC8928"> Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for
    Low-Power and Lossy Networks </xref> was defined to protect the ownership of unicast IPv6 addresses that are registered with
    <xref target="RFC8505"/>.

</t>
<!--t><xref target="RFC8928"/> defines the "C" flag but fails to explicit the bit number and fails to make a IANA registration for that bit position. On the other hand, a position for the bit (bit 3) is represented in Figure 1 of <xref target="RFC8928"/>. <xref target="RFC9685"/> defines the P-Field in bits 2 and 3 of the EARO flags field, obtains a proper IANA registration, but causes an overlap with the representation in Figure 1 of <xref target="RFC8928"/>. This specification updates <xref target="RFC8928"/> to position the "C" flag as bit 1 of the EARO flag, as represented in <xref target="EARO"/>, to avoid the overlapping definitions.
</t-->
<t>
    With <xref target="RFC8928"/>, it is possible for a node to autoconfigure a
    pair of public and private keys and use them to sign the registration of
    addresses that are either autoconfigured or obtained through other methods.

</t>
<t>
    The first hop router (the 6LR) can then validate a registration and
    perform source address validation on packets coming from the sender node
    (the 6LN).

</t>
<t>
    As multiple nodes may register the same prefix, the method specified
    in <xref target="RFC8928"/> cannot be used with node-local
    autoconfigured keypairs, which protect a single ownership only.
</t>
<t>
    For a prefix, as for an anycast or a multicast address, it is still possible
    to leverage <xref target="RFC8928"/> to enforce the right to register.
    If <xref target="RFC8928"/> is used, a keypair MUST be created and
    associated with the prefix before the prefix is deployed, and a ROVR MUST be
    generated from that keypair as specified in <xref target="RFC8928"/>.
    The prefix and the ROVR MUST then be installed in the 6LBR at the first
    registration, or by an external mechanism such as IP Address Management 
	(IPAM) or DHCPv6 snooping prior to the first registration. 
	This way, the 6LBR can recognize the prefix
    on the future registrations and validate the right to register based on the
    ROVR.
</t>
<t>
    The keypair MUST then be provisioned in each node that needs to
    register the prefix or a prefix within, so the node can follow the
    steps in <xref target="RFC8928"/> to register the prefix.
</t>
<t>
    Upon receiving an NA Message with the status set to 5 "Validation Requested", the
    node that registered the address or prefix performs the proof of ownership based
	on that longest prefix match.
</t>
</section>  <!-- Updating RFC 8928 -->


<section  anchor="ext8929"><name>Extending RFC 8929</name>
<t>
  <xref target="RFC8929">"IPv6 Backbone Router"</xref> defines a proxy 
  operation whereby a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR)
  may impersonate a 6LN  when performing an address registration.
  In that case, <xref target="RFC8505"/> messages are used as is, with
  one change that the SLLAO in the proxied NS(EARO) messages indicates the 
  Registering Node (the 6LBR) as opposed to the Registered Node (the 6LN).
  See figure 5 of <xref target="RFC8929"/> for an example of proxy operation
  by the 6LBR, which generates an NS(EARO) upon receiving an EDAR message.
</t>
<t>
  This specification Extends that proxy operation with the updates in <xref target="RFC9685"/>
  and this on the formats and content of the EARO, the EDAR, and the EDAC messages, 
  to support the P-Field and the signaling of prefixes. The proxy MUST use the P-Field as received 
  in the EDAR or NS(EARO) message to generate the proxied NS(EARO), and it MUST
  use the exact same prefix and prefix length as received in the case of 
  a prefix registration.
  
</t>  
</section>  <!-- Updating RFC 8929 -->

<section  anchor="sec"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>
    This specification extends <xref target="RFC8505"/>, and
    the security section of that document also applies to this document.
    In particular, the link layer SHOULD be sufficiently
    protected to prevent rogue access, else a rogue node with physical Access
    to the network may inject packets and perform an attack from within.
</t>
<t>
   <xref target="sec8928"/> leverages <xref target="RFC8928"/> to prevent a
   rogue node to register a unicast address that it does not own.
   The mechanism could be extended to anycast and multicast addresses if the
   values of the ROVR they use is known in advance, but how this is done is
   not in scope for this specification.
   One way would be to authorize in advance the ROVR of the valid users.
   A less preferred way could be to synchronize the ROVR and TID values across
   the valid registering nodes as a preshared key material.
</t>
<t>
   In the latter case, it could be possible to update the keys associated to
   a prefix in all the 6LNs, but the flow is not clearly documented and may
   not complete in due time for all nodes in LLN use cases. It may be simpler
   to install an all-new address with new keys over a period of time, and
   switch the traffic to that address when the migration is complete.
</t>
</section>	<!-- end section "Security Considerations" -->

<section anchor="back"><name>Backward Compatibility</name>

<t>
   A legacy 6LN will not register prefixes and the service will be
   the same when the network is upgraded. A legacy 6LR will not set the F flag
   in the 6CIO and an upgraded 6LN will not register prefixes.
</t>
<t>
   Upon an EDAR message, a legacy 6LBR may not realize that the address being
   registered is anycast or multicast, and return that it is duplicate in the
   EDAC status. The 6LR MUST ignore a duplicate status in the EDAR for anycast
   and multicast addresses.
